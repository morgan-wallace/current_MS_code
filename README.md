# current_MS_code

Current errors:
I don't know how to fix this-- I think it is to do with the size of the array/ matrix-- as the they are being  graphed? (because they are not the same L * W) in number--- but I can't seem to find a solution around it. I know there must be one-- because I have done something like this in python--- so it must be a common problem-- but with these code strings-- I am at a loss.
